# Luna - Chess Engine

A comprehensive chess engine and game development project implementing a bitboard-based chess engine with UCI protocol extensions and an integrated SDL-based game interface.

## Project Overview

ChessLab consists of three primary components that work together to create a complete chess playing experience:

### ðŸŽ¯ **ChessRules** 
Core chess logic library containing:
- Bitboard-based board representation
- Move generation and validation
- Chess rule enforcement (castling, en passant, check detection)
- Position management and FEN parsing
- Zobrist hashing for position identification

### ðŸ§  **ChessEngine (Luna)**
UCI-compatible chess engine featuring:
- Alpha-beta search with various optimizations
- Transposition tables with Zobrist hashing for position caching and search optimization
- Position evaluation functions
- Standard UCI protocol implementation
- Custom UCI extensions for enhanced debugging and rule customization
- Performance testing (perft) validation
- Builds as `luna.exe` in the ChessEngine directory

### ðŸŽ® **GameEngine**
SDL3-based game interface providing:
- Visual chess board and piece rendering
- Player input handling and move validation
- Windows process spawning with anonymous pipes for UCI-compliant engine communication
- Integration with chess engine for computer opponents
- Scene-based architecture supporting multiple game modes
- Audio and visual effects using FMOD
- Configurable engine path support (via config file or command line)

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- Visual Studio 2022 (Windows) or equivalent C++17 compiler
- SDL3 and FMOD libraries (included in `lib/` directory)

### Build Instructions

1. **Create build directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

2. **Generate project files:**
   ```bash
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
   ```

3. **Build all components:**
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --config Debug
   ```

   For release builds:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

### Build Outputs

After building, you'll find the following executables:

- **`luna.exe`** - Built in `build/src/ChessEngine/Debug/` (or `Release/`)
  - Standalone UCI chess engine
  - Can be used with any UCI-compatible chess GUI
  
- **`game_engine.exe`** - Built in `build/src/GameEngine/Debug/` (or `Release/`)
  - Interactive chess game with SDL3-based GUI
  - Communicates with chess engines via UCI protocol
  
- **`chess_rules`** - Static library linked into other components

## Configuration

### Engine Path Configuration

The game engine can locate the chess engine in two ways:

1. **Config file** (`resources/config.txt`):
   ```
   engine_path = build/src/ChessEngine/Debug/luna.exe
   ```

2. **Command line arguments** (takes precedence over config file):
   ```bash
   # Using --engine flag
   ./game_engine.exe --engine path/to/your/engine.exe
   
   # Using --engine= syntax
   ./game_engine.exe --engine=path/to/your/engine.exe
   
   # Show help
   ./game_engine.exe --help
   ```

Command line arguments will update the config file with the specified engine path.
